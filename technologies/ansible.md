## Ansible Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
Before installing Ansible, ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- **Python Version**: Ansible requires Python 3.6 or higher. You can verify this by running `python3 --version` in your terminal.

### Step 1: Check Python Version
Run the command to check your Python version and ensure it's compatible with Ansible:

```bash
python3 -m pip --version
```

**Note**: If your Python version is below 3.6, consider upgrading before proceeding.

### Step 2: Install Pip
Pip is a package installer for Python, essential for installing Ansible. Follow these steps to install it:

1. Download the `get-pip.py` script:
   ```bash
   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
   ```
2. Install pip using Python 3:
   ```bash
   python3 get-pip.py --user
   ```

**Note**: The `--user` flag installs pip in your user directory, avoiding the need for administrative privileges.

### Step 3: Install Ansible Core
Ansible core contains essential modules and plugins. Install it using pip:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user ansible-core
```

**Verification**: After installation, check if Ansible is recognized by running:
```bash
ansible --version
```

### Step 4: Install Ansible Development Tools
These tools aid in writing and testing playbooks. Install them with:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user ansible-dev-tools
```

**Note**: This includes tools like `ansible-lint` for code quality checks.

### Step 5: Add Local Bin to PATH
To access installed binaries, add the local bin directory to your PATH:

1. Edit your `.bashrc` file:
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="~/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```
2. Reload your bash configuration:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

**Note**: This ensures commands like `ansible` are accessible from any directory.

### Step 6: Verify Installation
Confirm Ansible is correctly installed by checking its version:

```bash
ansible --version
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ansible 2.x.x
...
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Permission Issues**: If installation fails due to permissions, try using `sudo` or check your user's write permissions.
- **PATH Not Updated**: If commands aren't recognized, ensure you reloaded `.bashrc` and the path is correctly set.
